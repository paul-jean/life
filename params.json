{"name":"Life","tagline":"","body":"## Game of Life in Javascript\r\n\r\nThis is a minimal implementation of Conway's Game of Life, for the purposes of exploring \r\ndifferent Javascript user interface frameworks.  \r\n\r\nSo far there are implementations using:\r\n- native Javascript graphics (HTML5 canvas)\r\n- D3.js (SVG)\r\n- React.js (SVG)  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nClone this repo:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[rule146@rule146: code]$ git clone https://github.com/jskelcy/life.git\r\nCloning into 'life'...\r\nremote: Counting objects: 178, done.\r\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (124/124), done.\r\nremote: Total 178 (delta 70), reused 147 (delta 53)\r\nReceiving objects: 100% (178/178), 259.97 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.\r\nResolving deltas: 100% (70/70), done.\r\nChecking connectivity... done.\r\n[rule146@rule146: code]$ cd life/\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck out the branch with the implementation you're interested in. To see the HTML5 canvas implementation check out the 'canvas' branch:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[rule146@rule146: life]$ git checkout canvas\r\nSwitched to branch 'canvas'\r\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/canvas'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the d3.js implementation, check out the 'd3' branch:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[rule146@rule146: life]$ git checkout d3\r\nSwitched to branch 'd3'\r\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/d3'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe react.js implementation is (currently) on the 'master' branch:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[rule146@rule146: life]$ git checkout master\r\nSwitched to branch 'master'\r\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart a local http server in this repo (here I'm using port 8000) and open localhost in chrome:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[rule146@rule146: life]$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 &\r\n[1] 3548\r\n[rule146@rule146: life]$ Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...\r\n[rule146@rule146: life]$ open -a /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/ http://localhost:8000\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see a grid and some buttons for controlling the update animation:\r\n\r\n![Game of Life screenshot](images/d3-screenshot.png \"Game of Life screenshot\")\r\n\r\nHere's what the animation looks like:\r\n\r\n![Game of Life animation](images/gol-d3-random.gif \"Game of Life update animation\")\r\n\r\n### Project page\r\n\r\nSee the project page [here](http://jskelcy.github.io/life/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
